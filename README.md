# Fungi-Growth-Interactive
This is an interactive jupyter notebook modeling the growth of competing fungi. It is a response to the 2021 MCM problem A. 

To run the interactive model, you must download the jupyter notebook and the two libraries, `plotlymath.py` and `myutils.py`. Make sure to import them as modules.
