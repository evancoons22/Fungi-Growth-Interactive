# Fungi-Growth-Interactive
This is an interactive jupyter notebook modeling the growth of competing fungi. It is a response to the 2021 MCM problem A. 

## Our Response 

Our response to this question includes 2 parts. The first is a spatial stochastic model. We assumed a fixed square of 'food' for the fungi to grow over and differing growth rates based on environmental conditions (see prompt). The model is a visual simulation over time with random fungi growth and many different scenarios- combinations of different growth rates, linear and logistic, and abilities to overtake other fungi. We used plotly to create an interactive time bar to watch the fungi grow over time

The second response was a Lotka-Volterra Model. We plotted eigenvalues and different scenarios to understand behavior; more detail is included in the jupyter notebook. 

## Running the Notebook

To run the interactive model (specifically the spatial stochastic model), you must download the jupyter notebook and the two libraries, `plotlymath.py` and `myutils.py`. Make sure to import them as modules.
